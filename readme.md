# Encryptor

This project is a small one I've been working on during class and sometimes at home.
It doesn't really serve a purpose, it's just for me to practice.

My goal with this project is to make some type of ransomware (not really) that encrypts files and then decrypts them.
I do want to try using MicroPython to load it onto a Raspberry Pi Pico and have it auto-run on a computer once plugged in.
